# Faculty

This repository serves as a basic introduction to working with PHP and databases. The objective is to guide users through the fundamental steps of working with PHP, creating a database, and handling data related to students within a faculty system.

After successfully installing and setting up the necessary software (PHP, MySQL, and a web server), the first step in working with data is creating a database. In this example, we will create a database called **faculty** that will store data about students.
